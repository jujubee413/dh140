[Parler’s amateur coding could come back to haunt Capitol Hill rioters, By Dan Goodin](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/01/parlers-amateur-coding-could-come-back-to-haunt-capitol-hill-rioters/)

#### __Summary__
As technology advances, so does our ability to share pieces of information about ourselves in the online world, but not always with our knowledge. One such article, “Parler’s amateur coding could come back to haunt Capitol Hill rioters” by Dan Goodin, explains precisely that. In the article Goodin explains how  thousands of photos of the uprising were shared on the mock twitter app “Parler”, only for users to later find out that the media posted on their accounts also shared their phone GPS metadata connecting many to the scene of the crime. Goodmin then explains that one such online user, who goes by the username donk_enby, was able to scrape this information off of Parlers site in order to preserve the self incriminating evidence as users ran online in an attempt to delete it. Goodin elaborates that because of Parlers lax moderation policies, they failed to scrub photos of geolocations and actually delete such posts from these sites, thus allowing hackers such as donk_enby to scrape this information even after it was supposedly “deleted”. Ultimately, Parlers lack of server security allowed for donk_enby to retain over 80 Terabytes of information which will likely assist law enforcement to arrest those found of inciting or taking part in the violence at the capital.
#### __Critical Reflection__
Honestly, I was intrigued by this article for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, for purely personal reasons, I was happy to see that justice could be served for those found inciting violence at the capital. But besides personal reasons, I was more intrigued and quite frankly surprised at the ease of which someone was able to gather this information, and which ultimately adds to my understanding of the “mirage” of privacy many users feel like they have online. As the saying goes, “what's posted on the internet, stays on the internet”, and while this time many may be happy to see technology used to take down domestic terrorists, it is even more daunting that this same process of “scraping” could be used for more nefarious actions, such as scraping another app for personal information which could be used against unknowing citizens. This really makes internet users like myself more cautious of what we put online, for the fact that what is uploaded will likely be there forever, and thus could be used against us one day. So in regards to research, I think when researchers compile data, it is of the utmost importance that they are aware of the security measures in place of the online domain they are using in order to protect the confidentiality of the research at hand (or for those involved in research). In the end, this both excites me and scares me, for the idea that data can be used to find and stop those who have committed heinous actions, but also data science can be used for nefarious actions.
