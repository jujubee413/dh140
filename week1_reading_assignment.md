# Week 1 Reading Assingment
### _by Juliette Oliver_

#### __Summary__
As technology advances, so does our ability to share pieces of information about ourselves in the online world, but not always with our knowledge. One such article, “Parler’s amateur coding could come back to haunt Capitol Hill rioters” by Dan Goodin, explains precisely that. In the article Goodin explains how  thousands of photos of the uprising were shared on the mock twitter app “Parler”, only for users to later find out that the media posted on their accounts also shared their phone GPS metadata connecting many to the scene of the crime. Goodmin then explains that one such online user, who goes by the username donk_enby, was able to scrape this information off of Parlers site in order to preserve the self incriminating evidence as users ran online in an attempt to delete it. Goodin elaborates that because of Parlers lax moderation policies, they failed to scrub photos of geolocations and actually delete such posts from these sites, thus allowing hackers such as donk_enby to scrape this information even after it was supposedly “deleted”. Ultimately, Parlers lack of server security allowed for donk_enby to retain over 80 Terabytes of information which will likely lead to the arrests of domestic terrorists all from a little too much information being shared without their knowledge.
#### __Critical Reflection__
Honestly, I was intrigued by this article both because, on one hand, I am happy to see justice possibly served to those who try to overrun a democratic election, but of course more importantly, I think this article speaks out about the mirage of “privacy” that exists online. As the saying goes, what's posted on the internet, stays on the internet, and I think when researchers are compiling data, it is of the utmost importance to protect the privacy of those involved within the research. So within my own research, this further reinforces the idea to be aware of the content you are uploading and the security of platforms or other softwares protecting such data. In regards to my own data science goals, it informs me that there is more data beneath the surface of what appears to be used.
