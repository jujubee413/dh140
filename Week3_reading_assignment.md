# *__Collected Data for Collective Causes__*
## _By Juliette Oliver_
While the internet's power and potential should not be taken lightly, I am always stunned and inspired by the incredible ways in which people use it to create positive change in our world. What's even better is that this change is not affected by only the rich or wealthy, but comes from everyday people just willing to make a difference. This is how I see this story of how communities and volunteers around the world, with only a computer and internet connection, made palpable changes for the communities who need it most through “Missing Maps”

Through the power of open data, thousands of volunteers were able to affect real change with help of the Red Cross and Missing Maps. I think something that is so valuable about these open source databases is their ability to be accessible by anyone for free. Most importantly, this means that people from within the community needing help are able to contribute and give important information that other organizations will then be able to use to make contributions to such neighborhoods. This means that less money and time will be spent on trying to gather this information that volunteers could help gather more quickly and for free, and that these funds could then go towards more important aspects of the project. I think the only thing to keep in mind is that, potentially, someone could use this data to cause harm to others in the community, but I believe the good far outweighs the possible cons.

Open data has many limitless potentials, and I think its uses can be used to help both private and public organizations. I think that open sourced data shines in its ability to provide large amounts or specific and intimate data on places of the world/ a subject that would be very difficult to recreate without the help of local volunteers. For example, without locals in a specific city offering up information about their locations and the surrounding area, many researchers or field workers could not/ would face an extremely daunting challenge or trying to gain that same amount of information for their studies. This information could then help a number of NGOs, and help in situations of disaster or economic unrest or any time really. 
(One such project I was helping with was the UNs CrowdMapping campaign to help survivors of FGM in Tanzania. With the help of thousands of volunteers, we helped sort through satellite images to create discernable maps used by first responders to fight FGM. So a lot of good can be done with open source data and people willing to use the data to make a change)

Ultimately, I think me and my cohort could use our unique and individual passions to research real problems within society. With our research and open data, we could creat data visualizations that shine a light on an issue, and use this data to compel others in local or national government to see why such problems need solving. Ultimately, data can allow us to understand what problems are relevant (especially to us) and help solve them for others like ourselves.
