# _Iran and Hypercities_
## By Juliette Oliver

After reading about the uprising against the fraudulent elections in Iran and Hypercities, I can say that I am both impressed and nervous about the future of Digital Humanities. To address my first feeling, I am extremely impressed by the ways in which people have used social media to overcome censorship and disaster. It is extraordinary that citizens of Iran were able to turn the tides against the authoritarian government in order to spread the word of their injustices to the world. It really goes to show the ability for social media to give a voice to those whom the powerful once deemed silent. On the other hand, what I think is also disturbing is the fact that the Government recognizes the true power behind these voices and is not afraid to start targeting them one by one until the cry for justice quiets down to that of whisper. What I also think is concerning is the idea mentioned in the reading of an ”echo chamber” of misinformation. While social media gives us an opportunity to join with and strengthen the collective voices for noble causes, with misinformation, this powerful entity then has the ability to spread and echo harmful information that is believed by others only due to the sheer volume of people believing in it (which I think was perfectly said in the article). Ultimately this reading really exemplifies the power that Social Media and Digital Humanities has for better and for worse, and we can only hope that going into the future that these instruments for connection and gathering are used for the right reasons and with good intent. Personally, as more and more events such as the Twitter revolution in Iran happen, I get more nervous that if not already, that the government will gain superior techniques and technological devices to silence protesters. They definitely have more money, more time, and more manpower to keep up in the ever changing technology sphere, and they will continue to develop this technology in order to silence others who disagree with their position. In addition, it is already difficult to pass laws protecting the privacy of online users, and I know these loose restrictions will be used against those who are unaware of the threat of censorship or jailing. Take for example the BLM protests. The FBI and police targeted Black activists and sent police to their front doors in acts of intimidation all because they were able to find their information from metadata online. To me, these sorts of threatening acts are grave violations of user privacy, since there was no imminent threat or reason to target these individuals and take their metadata except for the fact that they were protesting against the corrupt police force. This intimidation did nothing but show citizens “we are watching, and we are not afraid to take action". Ultimately, as technology advances, I am hopeful about society's ability to connect for social good, but I worry that as long as the government has the upperhand in the technological censorship game, that we still will play by their rules, that as we can see in Iran, can be rigged.

My questions to the author after reading this article would be “In what ways do you feel that social media platforms have a responsibility to the public to provide open and unbiased spaces for dialogue? Do private companies have any sort of ethical duty to step in and censor what they deem harmful to society? What laws and protections should governments create in order to preserve user privacy of their citizens?
