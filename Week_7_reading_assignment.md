# _Iran and Hypercities_
## By Juliette Oliver

After reading about the uprising against the fraudulent elections in Iran and Hypercities, I can say that I am both impressed and nervous about the future of Digital Humanities. To address my first feeling, I am extremely impressed by the ways in which people have used social media to overcome censorship and disaster. It is extraordinary that citizens of Iran were able to turn the tides against the authoritarian government in order to spread the word of their injustices to the world. It really goes to show the ability for social media to give a voice to those whom the powerful once deemed silent. On the other hand, what I think is also disturbing is the fact that the Government recognizes the true power behind these voices and is not afraid to start targeting them one by one until the cry for justice quiets down to that of whisper. What I also think is concerning is the idea mentioned in the reading of an ”echo chamber” of misinformation. While social media gives us an opportunity to join with and strengthen the collective voices for noble causes, with misinformation, this powerful entity then has the ability to spread and echo harmful information that is believed by others only due to the sheer volume of people believing in it (which I think was perfectly said in the article). Ultimately this reading really exemplifies the power that Social Media and Digital Humanities has for better and for worse, and we can only hope that going into the future that these instruments for connection and gathering are used for the right reasons and with good intent. 

My questions to the author after reading this article would be “In what ways do you feel that social media platforms have a responsibility to the public to provide open and unbiased spaces for dialogue? Do private companies have any sort of ethical duty to step in and censor what they deem harmful to society? What laws and protections should governments create in order to preserve user privacy of their citizens?
