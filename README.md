# __*Welcome to Juliette Olivers Data Space*__ :smile: !
I am excited about the opportunity to broaden my skillset as a **humanist** throught this next quarter.
Although this class is quite different from my typical schedule as a _Russian Studies Major_ , 
I am excited for the challanges and growth that lay ahead.
  As the great T.S Elliot once said:
>If you're not in over your head,
>how do you know how tall you are?
#### Goals
_Specifically_, here are a list of the things I hope to accomplish in DH140
1. Learn how to use Python 
2. Learn to create visualizations using code to forward humanistic stories
3. Create publication ready-scholerly materials for my own research 

In order to achieve these goals, I hope to use data from [Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
 to guide my research inquiry about the affects of Airbnb on neighborhoods.
