# __*Welcome to Juliette Olivers Data Space*__ :smile: !
I am excited about the opportunity to broaden my skillset as a **humanist** throughout this next quarter.
Although this class is quite different from my typical schedule as a _Russian Studies Major_ , 
I am excited for the challanges and growth that lay ahead.
  As the great T.S Elliot once said:
>If you're not in over your head,
>how do you know how tall you are?
#### Goals
_Specifically_, here are a list of the things I hope to accomplish in DH140
1. Learn how to use Python 
2. Learn to create visualizations using code to forward humanistic stories
3. Create publication ready-scholerly materials for my own research 

In order to achieve these goals, I hope to use data from [Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
 to guide my research inquiry to learn about the affects of Airbnb on neighborhoods and refine my coding skills.
### Possible research inquiry questions
My interest in Airbnb is due to my curiosity to understand how the emergence of "Gig Economies" affect local markets.
Some questions I hope to find answers to are:
* How does Airbnb affect local housing markets?
* How does Airbnb affect students in Westwood?
* Does Airbnb affect long term or short term housing availability?
* How does Airbnb affect other markets, such as the resturant industry or entertainment? 
* Does Airbnb lead to a rise in gentrification?
