# __*Welcome to Juliette Olivers Data Space*__ :smile: !
*__Hello Everyone!__* Welcome to my space where I will be tackling DH140 this quarter at UCLA. 
I am extremely excited about this opportunity to broaden my skillset and learn skills that will be invaluable in my coming years in academia.
Although this class is quite different from my typical classes as a _Russian Studies Major_ , 
I eagerly await the challanges and growth that lay ahead.
  As was once well said by T.S Elliot:
>If you're not in over your head,
>how do you know how tall you are?

### What is DH140?
In this class, students like myself will be be introduced to the groundworks of coding and data science for __humanist__. We will tackle the basics of Python and learn basic data science tools, eventually working our way up to geospatial analysis and GIS. In the end, the skills gained from this course will allow us to critically and accuratly analyze humanistic data and help forward our endeavours in humanistic research!
___
### Goals
_Specifically_, here are a list of the things I hope to accomplish in DH140
1. Learn how to use Python 
2. Learn to create visualizations using code to forward humanistic stories
3. Create publication ready-scholerly materials for my own research 

___

In order to achieve these goals, I hope to use data from [Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
 in order to guide my research inquiry and refine my coding skills.
### Possible research inquiry questions
My interest in Airbnb is due to my curiosity to understand how the emergence of "Gig Economies" affect local markets.
Some questions I hope to find answers to are:
* How does Airbnb affect local housing markets?
* How does Airbnb affect students in Westwood?
* Does Airbnb affect long term or short term housing availability?
* How does Airbnb affect other markets, such as the resturant industry or entertainment? 
* Does Airbnb lead to a rise in gentrification?

### _**Who I am and what I hope to do after DH140?**_
So I am officialy a *Russian Studies Major* and a *DH minor*, and I am persuing DH in order to learn valuable knowledge that will assist me in my Russian Studies. Specifically, I have a passion for Central Asia and Kazakhstan, and I hope that after this class is done that I am able to use my skills to show my findings about the different ethnic groups in Kazakhstan! :kazakhstan:
Other projects I hope to persue after or during DH140 are
* Mapping and understanding the change in ethnic group populations after the reign of Stalin
* Маp and understand traditional migratory patterns of nomadic Kazakh tribes in the Altai mountains
* Understand the detrimental impact of Nuclear testing on Kazakh populations
* Understand the shifting demogaphic change in citizens who idetify with Kazakh as their first language

Thank you for your interst in my work, and I look forward to a vigerous and enriching quarter of coding! :smiley:
